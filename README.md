## 📘 About
This repository contains **self-contained C# code snippets** that cover:
- Basics of the language  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts  
- Data Structures & Algorithms  
- Exception handling, threading, delegates, events  
- LINQ, async/await, and advanced C# features  
- Small **mini projects** and practice programs  

Each file/folder is **independent** so you can copy, run, and learn directly.
